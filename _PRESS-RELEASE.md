# Project Name #
Fire Emblem Arena

## Heading ##
  Fire Emblem Mock Battle

## Sub-Heading ##
  Fire Emblem fans can stage battles between any two characters of their choice.

## Summary ##
  This app will allow fans of the Fire Emblem series of games to select two characters,
  one to attack and one to defend, and get the stats for both characters as well as
  how much damage they would do to each other.

## Problem ##
  Currently, if you wish to calculate how one character would compare to another,
  you might bring up the wiki page for any characters and look at their stats. You
  might have to do some math to determine what their stats might be at any particular
  level then do more math to compare those stats against another character. This
  app will simplify that process by providing a user a simple interface for making
  comparisons.

## Solution ##
  The main goal is to allow a user to select one character then select another.
  Once both characters have been selected, a third section will show stats
  as well as damage output. In this way, all information is displayed in one place.

## Quote from You ##
  "This Fire Emblem app is gonna be y'uge."

## How to Get Started ##
  UI-router should deeply aid in the production of this app, due to the complexity
  of having more than one view at a time. The most difficult part will be getting
  the views hooked up, but after that, the aspects of the database and calculations
  should be relatively simple.

## Customer Quote ##
  "I click a few buttons and there on the screen were the stats for both characters.
  It even details how well a character would perform against another. It saved me
  a good bit of time."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  I look forward to the release of this MVP. For more information, please email
