There is an approach called "working backwards" that is widely used at Amazon. They work backwards from the customer, rather than starting with an idea for a product and trying to bolt customers onto it. While working backwards can be applied to any specific product decision, using this approach is especially important when developing new products or features.

For new initiatives a product manager typically starts by writing an internal press release announcing the finished product. The target audience for the press release is the new/updated product's customers, which can be retail customers or internal users of a tool or technology. Internal press releases are centered around the customer problem, how current solutions (internal or external) fail, and how the new product will blow away existing solutions.

If the benefits listed don't sound very interesting or exciting to customers, then perhaps they're not (and shouldn't be built). Instead, the product manager should keep iterating on the press release until they've come up with benefits that actually sound like benefits. Iterating on a press release is a lot less expensive than iterating on the product itself (and quicker!).

If the press release is more than a page and a half, it is probably too long. Keep it simple. 3-4 sentences for most paragraphs. Cut out the fat. Don't make it into a spec. You can accompany the press release with a FAQ that answers all of the other business or execution questions so the press release can stay focused on what the customer gets. My rule of thumb is that if the press release is hard to write, then the product is probably going to suck. Keep working at it until the outline for each paragraph flows.

Oh, and I also like to write press-releases in what I call "Oprah-speak" for mainstream consumer products. Imagine you're sitting on Oprah's couch and have just explained the product to her, and then you listen as she explains it to her audience. That's "Oprah-speak", not "Geek-speak".

Once the project moves into development, the press release can be used as a touchstone; a guiding light. The product team can ask themselves, "Are we building what is in the press release?" If they find they're spending time building things that aren't in the press release (overbuilding), they need to ask themselves why. This keeps product development focused on achieving the customer benefits and not building extraneous stuff that takes longer to build, takes resources to maintain, and doesn't provide real customer benefit (at least not enough to warrant inclusion in the press release).

## Heading ##
  > Name the product in a way the reader (i.e. your target customers) will understand.
  Fire Emblem Mock Battle

## Sub-Heading ##
  > Describe who the market for the product is and what benefit they get. One sentence only underneath the title.
  Fire Emblem fans can stage battles between any two characters of their choice.

## Summary ##
  > Give a summary of the product and the benefit. Assume the reader will not read anything else so make this paragraph good.
  This app will allow fans of the Fire Emblem series of games to select two characters,
  one to attack and one to defend, and get the stats for both characters as well as
  how much damage they would do to each other.

## Problem ##
  > Describe the problem your product solves.
  Currently, if you wish to calculate how one character would compare to another,
  you might bring up the wiki page for any characters and look at their stats. You
  might have to do some math to determine what their stats might be at any particular
  level then do more math to compare those stats against another character. This
  app will simplify that process by providing a user a simple interface for making
  comparisons.

## Solution ##
  > Describe how your product elegantly solves the problem.
  The main goal is to allow a user to select one character then select another.
  Once both characters have been selected, a third section will show stats
  as well as damage output. In this way, all information is displayed in one place.

## Quote from You ##
  > A quote from a spokesperson in your company.
  "This Fire Emblem app is gonna be y'uge."

## How to Get Started ##
  > Describe how easy it is to get started.
  UI-router should deeply aid in the production of this app, due to the complexity
  of having more than one view at a time. The most difficult part will be getting
  the views hooked up, but after that, the aspects of the database and calculations
  should be relatively simple.

## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
  "I click a few buttons and there on the screen were the stats for both characters.
  It even details how well a character would perform against another. It saved me
  a good bit of time."

## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > Wrap it up and give pointers where the reader should go next.
  I look forward to the release of this MVP. For more information, please email
